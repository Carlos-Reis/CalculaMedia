## CalculaMedia
The initial objective was to implement a function to calculate the average of 5 students ages, but I made it more generic.  
If anyone wants to improve or evolve this into a small simplified system , be my guest. I don't think I'll revisit it since it was a very simple request.  
As it was a simple request I enjoyed my time dealing with console changes since I don't use console applications that much.

> The console text is in portuguese as it was one of the required things

> Total time spent on it, about 5-7 minutes. Including time to play with the console 

###### Progress:
1. I started solving the original problem with 5 manual console iterations to get the data
2. As it was a simple average function it didnt't took much time, so I added more stuff like restarting the console after finishing
3. Then I changed it to use loops
4. After it I added try-catches
5. Then I put error messages in red, just because I wanted to
6. Then I moved the function to another class

###### Execution:
1. Download the code.
2. Execute it and follow what is written in the console.
